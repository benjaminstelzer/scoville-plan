# Development

The only installable Skill source is [`scoville-plan/`](../scoville-plan/).
This directory owns repository development and is not an installation package.

## Current layout

Paths recorded before the 2026-09-05 structure change are historical. Use this mapping
for current local files; frozen evidence retains its original contents and hashes.

| Former repository path | Current repository path |
| --- | --- |
| `docs` | `development/docs` |
| `tests` | `development/tests` |
| `PROJECT_INDEX.md` | `development/PROJECT_INDEX.md` |

Run development commands from this directory unless the command specifies otherwise.
The installable package is one directory above. Tests, when present, run with
`python -B -m unittest discover -s tests` in the existing development environment.
This move does not add dependencies or establish new model or host qualification.

The executable Plan-hygiene experiment uses `docs/benchmarks/plan-hygiene/protocol-structure-2026-09-05.json`
with hashes for the relocated sources. The original `protocol.json` and
`results.json` remain historical evidence. Run `python -B tests/plan_hygiene_experiment.py`
to produce a new result without overwriting them.

The native planning root is this directory: [`PROJECT_INDEX.md`](PROJECT_INDEX.md),
`docs/plans/` and `docs/decisions/` moved together.

## Frozen control texts

These files are evaluation inputs, not additional installable Skills. Their bytes
are unchanged. A new evaluation must copy the chosen control into its isolated
run directory as `SKILL.md`; never restore that name in this repository.

| Former path after directory move | Stored fixture path |
| --- | --- |
| `development/docs/benchmarks/plan-hygiene/baseline/SKILL.md` | `development/docs/benchmarks/plan-hygiene/baseline/SKILL.fixture.md` |
